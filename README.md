# Uncommon Python Error: ZeroDivisionError in Conditional Statement

This repository demonstrates a subtle ZeroDivisionError in a Python function. The error arises from a conditional check that fails to prevent division by zero under specific circumstances. The solution involves refining the conditional statement to handle the case where 'a' is zero gracefully. 

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and careful attention to edge cases when writing Python code.
